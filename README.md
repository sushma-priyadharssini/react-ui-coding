## 🚀 React Nuggets

A curated collection of small, functional applications - each crafted to explore a concept, pattern, or idea in a hands-on way to learn and apply core concepts in React, JavaScript, APIs, and UI design.

Each app is self-contained yet designed to teach something meaningful — from working with APIs, managing state, handling user input, to building reusable UI components.

While minimal in size, these apps are packed with practical knowledge, making them great references for learning, experimenting, and building confidence with System design in React. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind (optional)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## 📖 Learning Goals

- Learn React basics (state, props, hooks).

- Practice real-world problem solving with small apps.

- Improve UI building skills with responsive layouts.

- Explore component reusability and clean coding practices.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
